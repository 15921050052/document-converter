There are couple things that should be known before you run the test method.

2)SWFTools should be install on your computer. You can modify the path to adapter to your computer in Test class.

3)jacob-1.18-x86.dll or jacob-1.18-x64.dll should be added to system path. eg. put it into C:\Windows\System32
